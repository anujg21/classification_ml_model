The Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset is used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of various ML algorithms.

### Dataset 
The Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset is often used in machine learning (ML) as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of various ML algorithms. This dataset is commonly used because it contains real-world information related to a telemarketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese bank, and is large enough to provide meaningful results while being small enough to be easily manageable.

Additionally, the dataset provides a binary target variable (i.e., whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit or not), which makes it suitable for classification tasks, a common type of machine learning problem. Furthermore, the features of the dataset, such as age, job, education, etc., can also be used for regression tasks, making it a versatile dataset for testing a variety of ML algorithms.

In summary, the Portuguese Bank Marketing Dataset is widely used in ML due to its size, real-world relevance, and versatility as a benchmark for classification and regression tasks.

### Framework 
The CRISP-DM method is a structured approach to data analysis and can be applied to analyze the Portuguese bank marketing dataset. Here is a brief outline of how you can use the CRISP-DM method to compare various classifiers:
* Business Understanding: Define the problem you are trying to solve. In this case, you are trying to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic and marketing campaign data.
* Data Understanding: Load the Portuguese bank marketing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explore the data. This includes cleaning the data and handling any missing values.
* Data Preparation: Prepare the data for modeling by splitting the data into training and testing sets and converting categorical variables into numerical data using one-hot encoding.
* Modeling: Train various classifiers using the training data and make predictions on the test data. Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Evaluation: Compare classifiers' performance to determine which is better suited for the problem at hand.
* Deployment: Use the best-performing classifier to make predictions on new, unseen data and put the model into production.

### Data
The dataset you will use comes from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://student.emeritus.org/courses/5965/assignments/243751?module_item_id=1425052#:~:text=UCI%20Machine%20Learning,an%20external%20site.). The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. You can make use of CRISP-DM-BANK.pdf for more information on the data and features.

#### Data Preparation 
It comprises of many steps but remember to transform the data using the techiques in hand. 
* Normalization scales the data to be in the range of [0,1]. This is done by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and dividing it by the range of the feature.
* Standardization scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done by subtracting the mean of the feature and dividing it by the standard deviation of the feature.
* Both normalization and standardization are used to bring all the features to the same scale. This is important as KNN, and Logistic Regression models are sensitive to the scale of the features and can lead to incorrect predictions if features are on a different scale.
You can use the StandardScaler class from scikit-learn's preprocessing module to standardize your data. For normalization, you can use the MinMaxScaler class from the same module.
